# What is Django?
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

Django is a full-featured web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It provides a set of tools and libraries for building web applications, including an ORM, a templating engine, and a built-in admin interface.

## Environment Setup
To get started with Django, youâ€™ll need to install it on your computer. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal, after setting up a virtual environment:

```
# Windows
python -m venv .venv

# to activate the virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv

# to activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```
